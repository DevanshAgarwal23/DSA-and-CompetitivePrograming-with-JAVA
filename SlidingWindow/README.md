Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Junior Software Engineer position at Myntra's Supply Chain Management team, as advertised. With a solid background in developing scalable applications and a passion for leveraging cutting-edge technologies, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Myntra's innovative tech systems powering order management, warehouse management, logistics management, and customer relationship management across various channels.

Having worked on high-scale projects during my tenure at Paytm, I have gained valuable experience in building robust solutions that can handle substantial transaction volumes. My experience aligns closely with the responsibilities outlined in the job description, including writing maintainable, scalable, and efficient code, collaborating in cross-functional teams, following coding standards and unit-testing practices, and adhering to release cycles and deadlines.

I am particularly drawn to Myntra's SCM system, which plays a pivotal role in seller onboarding, inventory management, order fulfillment, and customer experience. The opportunity to work with technologies like GoLang, Java Spring, MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Aerospike, Redis, React, and Node.js is both challenging and exhilarating. I am eager to leverage my coding skills in Java/J2EE, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of web technologies and RDBMS to contribute to the success of Myntra's SCM systems.

What excites me most about joining Myntra's Supply Chain Management team is the opportunity to work on cutting-edge tech systems that impact every aspect of the customer journey. I am enthusiastic about collaborating with a talented and diverse team of professionals to solve complex challenges and drive innovation in the e-commerce industry.
